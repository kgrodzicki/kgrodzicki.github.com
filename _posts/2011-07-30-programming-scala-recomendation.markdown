I wrote this recomendation about one year ago on linkedin. I hope it will be still helpful.

Book title: [Programming Scala: Tackle Multi-Core Complexity on the Java Virtual Machine](ihttp://amzn.to/r0uRU3).

"In my opinion one of the best book for Java programmers who wants to start adventure with Scala 
programming language. Book is well written and easy to read, many code snippets that describes problem 
in details. However if you are looking for book which cover advanced Scala programming this book 
is not for you. After "Programming Scala" you have knowledge to easy start programming your own 
applications using Scala or mix it with Java code. If you want to start with Scala quickly this 
book is definitely for you!"
