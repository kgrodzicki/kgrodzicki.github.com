Recently I have changed my vim plugin configuration from [Pathogen](http://bit.ly/qA53WP) to 
[Vim Addon Manager](http://bit.ly/qAu2DM). After few days of using it, I can say it is pretty awesome.
With VAM I can simply use profiles, which I was really missing in my older config. For example 
``V=scala vim`` run vim with scala profile.
Example profiles configuration:


<script src="https://gist.github.com/1114762.js?file=vam.vim">
</script>


Adding/updating/removing plugins with VAM is straightforward. Refer to [VAM documentation](http://bit.ly/pzQrWS) for more details.

Fork my config on [github](http://bit.ly/qAu2DM). Many thanks for [MarcWeber](http://bit.ly/qFZ8zY) for inspiration.
